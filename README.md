# 🛒 E-Commerce RTK

A robust and modern e-commerce platform built with **React** and leveraging **Redux Toolkit** for efficient and scalable state management. This project aims to demonstrate best practices in building a full-featured online store interface, complete with a cart system, routing, and notifications, using modern frontend tools.

## ✨ Features

- **Global State Management:** Implemented using **Redux Toolkit** and **React Redux** for predictable and centralized application state (e.g., product data, shopping cart logic).
- **Modern UI/UX:** Styled using **Tailwind CSS** for rapid, utility-first styling and a fully responsive design.
- **Client-Side Routing:** Utilizes **React Router DOM** for seamless, single-page application navigation across different views.
- **API Communication:** Handles data fetching and interaction with the backend using **Axios**.
- **User Notifications:** Provides clear user feedback for actions (e.g., "Item added to cart") using **React Toastify**.
- **Fast Development:** Built with **Vite** for a lightning-fast development experience and optimized production builds.
